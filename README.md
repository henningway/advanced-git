# Advanced Git

Learn advanced git concepts by solving interactive exercises.

## Get Started

Clone this repository. Create a `.bin` directory inside the project. Go to
https://github.com/babashka/babashka/releases/ and find a release in the range of [1.3.188, 1.4). Download the correct 
binary for your platform (e.g. "babashka-1.3.188-linux-amd64.tar.gz") and unpack it inside the `.bin` directory so that
it is accessible under `.bin/bb`. 

`make run` to pick an exercise. Solve the exercise inside the created sub-directory. If you pick the same exercise again
you can reset it to its initial state.

`make reset` to delete the sub-directories of all exercises.

# Exercises

The exercises require explanation - which we didn't have time to write down yet. Get in touch if you are interested.
